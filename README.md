Since the 2016 election, the number of Democratic voters shrank in North Carolina. The drop in Democratic registration is more apparent outside of cities and areas where African-Americans are a bigger part of the electorate.  Less North Carolinians are also registered as Republican, but the drop is not as precipitous as that faced by democrats.

This Github repository is an analysis of voter registration in North Carolina.  The North Carolina State Board of Elections post regular reports on voter registration on their website at https://dl.ncsbe.gov/index.html?prefix=NVRA/NVRA%20Reports/

In particular, this analysis examines changes in voter registration from December 2016 until August 2018.  During this time, the state saw a drop in voters registered as Democratic, and this analysis examines factors related to this drop.
